I have been studying programming since 2023, and as a programmer, I don't waste time but rather focus on solidifying my learned knowledge and acquiring new skills.

Currently, I am working on projects as a Unity client programmer, and I am committed to expanding my abilities beyond specific languages to handle a wide range of projects. To this end, I am always engaged in new projects to transform what I learn into tangible outcomes.
